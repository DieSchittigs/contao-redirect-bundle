# contao-redirect-bundle
Manage redirects in the contao backend

This bundle uses the initializeSystem Hook to redirect URLs before the page will be rendered, so handle with care.

# Options: #
- redirect to 404 (useful for news/calendar reader pages without auto item)
- redirect static URLs 
- redirect via regex rules (search and replace)
